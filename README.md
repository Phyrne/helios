helios
======

A little script for controlling Philips hue lightbulbs

Usage
-----

    Usage: helios [-g] target action
    
      Specify a group of lights with '-g'
    
      Target - The light or group you want to interact with (defined by an integer)
    
      Actions: [on|off|toggle|status]

Notes
-----
This certainly comes in handy for when you want to manually control your hue lights.
It's extremely simple right now, but I plan on adding further functionality soon.

You could create launchers or menu's for ease of use. I've added a little drop-down menu to my
desktop panel to control different lights, nice and clicky!
